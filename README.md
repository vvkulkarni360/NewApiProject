# News App

Welcome to my ReactJS-based news app! üì∞

## Overview

This app showcases the latest news fetched from the NewsAPI website using an API key. It's designed to provide a seamless news browsing experience with various sections like Home, Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology.

## Features

1. **Multiple Sections**: Explore news from different fields, making it easy to stay updated.
2. **Search Bar**: Implemented using useState and prop drilling, allowing users to search for specific news topics.
3. **Loader**: Displays a loader until the news is fetched, ensuring a smooth user experience.
4. **Details Button**: Redirects users to the actual news article for in-depth reading.
5. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, ensuring a consistent experience.
6. **Infinite Scroll**: Implemented using react-infinite-scroll-component, replacing traditional pagination for seamless scrolling.

## Challenges Faced

The development of the search function posed a challenge initially, as it was my first time implementing it. However, with practice, it has become much easier to manage and enhance.

## Issues

One limitation of this project is that it cannot be hosted on any platform, as the NewsAPI website only allows news fetching on localhost and does not provide data when hosted externally.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project on GitHub. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Let's keep the news flowing! üåê #ReactJS #NewsApp #TechNews üöÄ
